# Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains the code and resources for building a Face Mask Detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system can detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not from an input image.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of two classes: "With Mask" and "Without Mask". It contains a collection of images labeled with the corresponding class. The dataset can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```
cd face-mask-detection
```

3. Prepare the dataset:

   - Download the dataset and extract it into the `data` directory.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

4. Train the model:

   - Run the training script:

   ```
   python train.py
   ```

   - The trained model will be saved in the `models` directory.

5. Evaluate the model:

   - Run the evaluation script:

   ```
   python evaluate.py
   ```

   - The script will evaluate the trained model on the testing set and provide accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

6. Make predictions:

   - To make predictions on new images, you can use the `predict.py` script:

   ```
   python predict.py --image [path-to-image]
   ```

   - The script will load the trained model and make predictions on the provided image, indicating whether a face mask is detected or not.
